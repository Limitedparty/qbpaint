qbPaint - paint tool on QBasic


Are you a masochist? Maybe madman, or student, studied QBasic? This tool for you. I highly recommend you **don't study the code of this project**, trust me - it works perfectly. If you ignore the warning, your psyche will suffer. Just use this code silently. Just paste it into the compiler and you're done.
